This project is about to create a python bot which is able to play blackjack as a perfect player. This
involves card counting (hi-lo method), choose what to do based on probabilities (base strategy and illustrious
strategy variation) and set a proper bet which has to match the advantage, or disadvantage).

The game is a simple js blackjack game I created for myself to train my card counting skills, for more 
information please check the game corresponding readme file.

This blackjack bot uses web scraping to interact with the game.

Feel free to report issue or suggest improvement. I'll be glad to receive tips cause this is my very fist python
real project (I mean I did it for myself, to do something I was interested in doing... Not just for learning 
purpose)

If you like blackjack as I do, I hope you'll like this project too
